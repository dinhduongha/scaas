# HANDOFF — scaas

## Shutdown 2026-10-06 — read this first

SCaaS = **SmartContract as a Service: the smart contracts themselves are the API services**. `scaas-node`
(doubles as relayer) is infrastructure anyone can run, with its own policies; it is not the product.
Repo `git@github.com:dinhduongha/scaas.git`, checked out as an independent nested repo at
`bamboo-dms/scaas/` (ignored by bamboo-dms). The Odoo addons (`dms_blockchain*`) stay in bamboo-dms and read
vectors from `scaas/…`.

### State

| | |
|---|---|
| `main` | pushed (see `git log`). Merge commits were linearised by `pull --rebase` — content is complete |
| Layout | `smartcontracts/{evm,move/{aptos,sui},soroban,cosmos,ton,solana,scripts}`, `scaas-node/`, `zether-prover/`, `clientkeys/`, `app/` (planned), `docs/` |
| Code landed this session | mesh S0 (gateway fee binding), S1a (consumed state, in bamboo-dms), S2 (R80), S3 (envelope + 32 vectors), P1 store v2 SQLite + review fixes, TW2 token wrappers v2 (EVM + Hedera), TON tx-hash fix, `bamboo → scaas` rename |
| Last gates | scaas-node `cargo test` 239/0 + clippy + e2e 4/4 (after P1 fix); forge 550/0 (TW2); every family e2e 1/1 (after rename); Odoo blockchain suite 432/0 (after rename) |
| Not deployed anywhere | domain tags renamed `bamboo.* → scaas.*` ⇒ every dev/test contract must be redeployed; DB rows `blockchain.token.domain_name` ("Bamboo MetaToken") and Cosmos `network_key` (`bamboo-1`) need updating after redeploy; operators rename env `BAMBOO_* → SCAAS_*`; every node needs `scaas-node store init` once (migration 0001 was edited in place — recreate dev `node.db`) |
| Worktrees | `.claude/worktrees/{p1,p1fix,rename,s3,tonhash,tw2}` — all merged; remove when convenient |

### Specs (all on `main`, `docs/superpowers/specs/`), rulings and review state

| Spec | Rulings | Rev | Review |

| `2026-10-06-pq-zether-design.md` (PQZ) | R270–R289 | 1.1 | review in flight at shutdown |
| `2026-10-06-universal-account-design.md` (UA) | R290–R318 | 1.2 (all owner items closed) | review in flight at shutdown |

Reviews (local, git-ignored): `docs/reviews/specs/`. Owner decisions are recorded inside each spec (owner-answers tables).

### Key owner rulings this session (details in the specs)

- Node independent of Odoo; Odoo is a client (push jobs, poll feeds). Store SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL (storage only).
- Admin auth: built-in users (CLI bootstrap) + optional OIDC; roles viewer ⊂ operator ⊂ admin + key_custodian.
  **API keys = external server-side clients only** (never in browser/mobile apps); automation = OIDC
  client-credentials or host CLI.
- Mesh: HTTP pull bus + libp2p gossip (QUIC default, hybrid X25519MLKEM768; TCP+Noise; HTTPS); private peers PQ-only.
- Universal Account: key-derived 32-byte kind-tagged ids, no wallet contract; native single-key accounts and 1271
  need no registration; one key = one purpose; purpose `m/7622'`; MetaToken v3 UA ledger; PQ + ed25519 everywhere;
  SubjectAccount kept as option (b); VC/eKYC optional.
- Token wrappers v2: three tiers, rates fixed/adjustable (issuer option), multi-underlying any-of, named `mtx*`
  functions, gasless unwrap with `minOut`.
- Owner wants **all specs finished before app code**.

### Constraints that bit this session

- Max 3 sub-agents; one heavy build at a time: wrap with `scaas/scripts/capped` (also `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4`).
- Worktrees need gitignored deps: copy `smartcontracts/evm/lib` (OpenZeppelin is a symlink to
  `/home/ha/work/blockchain/openzeppelin-contracts`), `mkdir smartcontracts/evm/deployments`, `npm ci` where needed;
  soroban e2e needs `STELLAR_BIN=~/.local/bin/stellar28`.
- `rtk` mangles `git diff`/`grep`/`ls` output in scripts — use `rtk proxy …` or `/usr/bin/grep`.
- Never `git commit -a` in scaas while an agent edits a spec in the main checkout (happened once: 9ad8711).
- Ruling-number ranges collided twice — reserve a range per spec before dispatching.
